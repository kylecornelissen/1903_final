### Iteration 4

Use TDD to add the following methods to your `Curator` class:

* `load_photographs(file)` - This method takes a path to a CSV file containing photographs and adds them to the `Curator`. You may find the included `FileIO` class useful.
* `load_artists(file)` - This method takes a path to a CSV file containing artists and adds them to the `Curator`. You may find the included `FileIO` class useful.
* `photographs_taken_between(range)` - This method takes a range and returns an array of all photographs with a year that falls in that range.
* `artists_photographs_by_age(artist)`- This method takes an `Artist` object and return a hash where the keys are the Artists age when they took a photograph, and the values are the names of the photographs.

````ruby
